# Project Proposal
The project's goal is to create an automated model for image submission that uses the image as an input and produces a text sequence explaining the image. We plan to make use of the Attention Mechanism and deploy a useable model on a cloud provider. 
We will use CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to do this. 

Goals:
 - Learn about Attention models
 - Learn hyperparam tuning
 - Work on both image and text level analysis
 
Benefits of image captioning are as follows: 
1. Catchy titles and captions can be generated by the model using existing social media data. A social media caption generator has a lot of business value in the current social media scenario.
2. Image to text -> TTS Captioning: Useful to people hard of sight who rely on sound or text to grasp the situation.
3. Real-time overview of videos, like Google does transcripting.

Potential Datasets to use:
Mining social media captions + images
